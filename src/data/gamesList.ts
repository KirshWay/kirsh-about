    review: `The Last of Us Part II is undoubtedly a technically outstanding project, yet it evokes mixed feelings, particularly regarding the balance between gameplay mechanics and narrative structure.
    From a gameplay perspective, the game left me with an overwhelmingly positive impression. The developers succeeded in creating a deep and varied system of interaction with the environment and enemies. I particularly want to highlight the detailed tactical possibilities: the ability to use low cover, crawl under obstacles like trucks, or flexibly plan actions for stealth sequences or direct confrontations ‚Äì all this demonstrates a high level of game design thought and provides the player with a wide scope for tactical experimentation.
    The game's visual component is executed at a superb level. Playing on the Steam Deck, I was pleasantly surprised by the quality of optimization for this device. Despite the project's scale and graphical detail, the game exhibits stable performance with a minimal number of freezes, which is rare for portable hardware and speaks to quality technical work. Visually, the game looks good even on the Steam Deck.
    However, the aspects concerning character development and the plotline felt, frankly, unnecessarily bloated and raised certain questions for me. The game touches upon the rather well-worn theme of the senselessness of revenge, which could potentially have been explored much more convincingly. As a result, the execution of this theme feels somewhat muddled. Character motivations and shifts in stance are often presented without sufficient justification or appear rushed, which hinders empathy and understanding of their actions. Furthermore, attempts to provide the player with moral "choices" ultimately have no significant impact on the plot's progression, undermining the sense of agency and making these moments feel formal.
    There is also a general sense of the narrative and gameplay sections being overly drawn out, particularly in the middle part of the game. The peak of this feeling occurred approximately upon reaching the island of the Seraphites.
    In conclusion, The Last of Us Part II undoubtedly deserves attention due to its outstanding gameplay foundation and magnificent technical execution. However, despite its ambition, the game's narrative part and character development raise questions and, in my opinion, do not reach the same level of perfection as the gameplay mechanics. The game should primarily be recommended to those who value deep and varied gameplay, rather than solely for the sake of the story.`,

    review: `In my childhood, I played a lot of classic RPGs ‚Äî the Fallout series, Neverwinter Nights, Arcanum, Planescape: Torment, and other genre masterpieces. That‚Äôs why I was particularly interested in what Larian Studios, the creators of Divinity: Original Sin, would come up with for the continuation of the legendary series. I really liked the game, although I played it during a period when time was tight (and even now, there‚Äôs not much of it üòµ‚Äçüí´üòÖ). I recommend starting it when you‚Äôre not too busy with other things ‚Äî this will allow you to fully immerse yourself. And if possible, play with someone close: a joint adventure with a loved one will make the experience even brighter and more emotional.

Immersion in the World: A Full-Fledged Universe
Baldur‚Äôs Gate 3 is not just a game, but a living, breathing world full of interesting characters and captivating adventures. Larian Studios have created a space where every decision affects the environment: you can explore hidden corners, interact with NPCs, and shape the story through choices. This is especially noticeable in the plot, which branches depending on your actions and decisions for your companions. For regular players, this means hours of engaging exploration, and for industry veterans ‚Äî an example of masterful narrative where nonlinearity doesn‚Äôt feel artificial but organically weaves into the gameplay.

Gameplay: Choices and Build-Crafting
The process of creating builds here is a real pleasure for fans of classic RPGs. You can experiment with classes, abilities, and tactics, adding depth and replayability. The battles are tactical, requiring strategy, yet accessible. I‚Äôve seen criticism from hardcore fans of the series and classic RPGs ‚Äî saying Larian simplified some aspects. You can partially agree with that, but let‚Äôs admit: the classic RPG genre isn‚Äôt as popular nowadays, and the studio adapted it for a wider audience without losing the essence. In the end, they did everything right ‚Äî the game balances depth and accessibility, making it appealing to both newcomers and gaming industry experts who value innovations in design.

Atmosphere and Characters: Emotions and Engagement
The characters here are alive and multifaceted, with deep backstories and dialogues that react to your choices. The atmosphere of Forgotten Realms is conveyed perfectly: from gloomy dungeons to epic quests. This creates a sense of a real adventure where every step can change the outcome ‚Äî ideal for those seeking emotional immersion.

Conclusion: Recommendation with a Caveat
Overall, Baldur‚Äôs Gate 3 is an outstanding example of a modern RPG that respects the genre‚Äôs roots but makes it relevant. Definitely give it a try if you love deep stories and tactical gameplay. I myself plan to return when I have more time and the mood for full immersion in this world again.`,

    review: `I first played the original Cyberpunk 2077 almost at launch, back when the game was a real battlefield of bugs and disappointments. Since then, the developers from CD Projekt Red have seriously worked on updates, and I decided to return to evaluate the changes. In the end, it‚Äôs a solid action-RPG in a futuristic setting, but without any revolutionary breakthrough. It doesn‚Äôt evoke a storm of emotions, remaining at the level of a ‚Äúgood, but ordinary‚Äù game. It‚Äôs especially disappointing, considering that cyberpunk is my favorite genre.

Gameplay and Technical Side: From Catastrophe to Improvements
At the start, the launch version was a real nightmare: terrible optimization, raw gameplay, and a bunch of underdeveloped systems. The progression system seemed weak and uninteresting, and elements like the logic of police chases were simply absent. The world of Night City felt empty, without depth in interactions.
However, after all the patches and updates, the picture has changed for the better. Now the progression is more complex and interesting ‚Äî it integrates better into the gameplay, allowing experimentation with builds and tactics. Combat has become more dynamic, and the city feels more alive. Nevertheless, the choice system remains quite compressed, as in most action-RPGs. Compared to classic role-playing masterpieces like Baldur‚Äôs Gate 3, where decisions branch endlessly, everything here is simpler and more predictable.
Despite the improvements, what saves the game above all is the atmosphere: neon lights, stylish design, and a soundtrack that perfectly conveys the cyberpunk vibe. Without this, it risked sinking into mediocrity.

Plot and Characters: Interesting, but Not Ideal
I completed the game even in its initial, ‚Äúraw‚Äù state, and it didn‚Äôt leave strong emotions ‚Äî just a pleasant adventure without a wow-effect. The overall tone is dark and cynical, which fits the genre, but it doesn‚Äôt always touch the soul.

DLC Phantom Liberty: Disappointment in Dogtown
I also played the DLC Phantom Liberty, which many praise as the best thing that happened to the game. Alas, I liked it less. The new location ‚Äî Dogtown ‚Äî seemed boring and monotonous, without the spark that the main Night City has. The characters here are bland, lacking charisma, and the story with its resolution came out obvious and primitive. Everything is too straightforward, without depth or surprises.
The plus is that the new ending from the DLC harmoniously fits into the tone of the original ‚Äî it maintains the same melancholy and hopelessness. If you‚Äôre a fan of the lore, this might hook you, but for me, the DLC didn‚Äôt live up to the hype.

Conclusion: Hopes for the Future
Overall, Cyberpunk 2077 after the updates is a solid game worth trying for its atmosphere, style, and music. But CD Projekt Red advertised it too aggressively as a revolution in the industry, promising to change everything. In reality, we got an ordinary title where the potential isn‚Äôt fully realized ‚Äî more systems, depth, and innovations could have been added.
Personally, I‚Äôm disappointed in the project: as a cyberpunk fan, I was waiting for a masterpiece but got ‚Äúwhat we have is what we have.‚Äù Nevertheless, I‚Äôll look forward to the sequel with interest and wish the team to implement all their planned ideas. The main thing is to approach marketing more cautiously to avoid repeating mistakes. If you haven‚Äôt played yet, start with the updated version ‚Äî it‚Äôs worth your time, especially if you love neon and hacker adventures.`,

    review: `This was my first game that I completed on the Nintendo Switch, and it left me with exclusively positive impressions. At first glance, the project might seem like purely children‚Äôs entertainment, but its strong side is in its ability to challenge even the most experienced gamers. Thanks to thoughtful game design, the game offers flexibility: those who prefer an easy playthrough without extra complexities can simply enjoy the adventure, while enthusiasts get the opportunity to dive deep into collecting all available items. The plot here is truly secondary ‚Äî the developers clearly prioritized gameplay, where each level offers unique mechanics and situations, making them genuinely memorable and diverse.

Gameplay: Perfect Balance for Everyone
The main charm of Super Mario 3D World lies in its accessibility and depth at the same time. Levels are built to provide a basic path for casual players, while hiding numerous secrets and challenges for those seeking a real test. Collecting stars, coins, and other items turns into an engaging process that motivates exploring every corner. This isn‚Äôt just a platformer ‚Äî it‚Äôs a masterclass in design, where creative mechanics (from costumes with superpowers to cooperative mode) make the playthrough fresh and dynamic.

DLC Bowser‚Äôs Fury: A Fresh Take on the Classic
I also completed the DLC Bowser‚Äôs Fury, and it truly hooked me. The shift in camera perspective to a more open, almost open-world style adds new dynamics to the adventure, with the collecting process taking center stage. Exploring locations brings real pleasure ‚Äî that sense of freedom and joy from discoveries is something I rarely encounter even in modern AAA projects. Battles with the giant Bowser add epicness, and the integration of collecting with the main gameplay makes the DLC compact yet rich in experience. If the original focuses on linear levels, here the emphasis is on free exploration, which perfectly complements the base game.

Visuals and Atmosphere: Brightness and Nostalgia
The visual style in both the main game and the DLC is simply captivating: bright colors, cute animations, and detailed worlds create an atmosphere of pure fun. I‚Äôm definitely coming back to collect all the collectible items in both parts ‚Äî this process doesn‚Äôt get boring and only heightens the desire to replay levels.

Conclusion: Recommendation for Adventure Lovers
Overall, Super Mario 3D World + Bowser‚Äôs Fury is an excellent example of how developers can create timeless classics that delight both newcomers and hardcore fans. The game doesn‚Äôt chase a complex plot but wins through flawless gameplay, variety, and visual charm. If you‚Äôre a Switch owner and haven‚Äôt tried it yet, this is a must-play ‚Äî especially for those who appreciate platformers with exploration elements. I‚Äôm thrilled and eagerly await the chance to return for the remaining trophies.`,

    title: 'Bayonetta',
    status: 'completed',
    rating: 7,
    year: 2009,
    review: `This is one of my favorite and most replayable games ‚Äî I‚Äôve completed it about 10 times and return to it with pleasure every time. As a fan of the Devil May Cry (DMC) series, I highly appreciate how Bayonetta, as a slasher, achieves a similar level of engaging gameplay. Of course, in many aspects it‚Äôs simpler than DMC, but it surpasses it in visual effects and dynamism, creating truly spectacular battles. The levels aren‚Äôt always diverse, but this is more than compensated by the outstanding combat system. Add to that the charismatic characters, especially Bayonetta herself, who spices everything up with humor and appears as an incredibly beautiful and charming heroine.

Gameplay: Dynamics and Spectacle
The combat system is the heart of Bayonetta, and it‚Äôs top-notch here. The game offers combos that you can hone endlessly, similar to DMC: experiment with moves to create more beautiful and powerful attack sequences. Unlike DMC, where effective fights require experience, in Bayonetta even beginners just mashing buttons randomly will get spectacular battles ‚Äî everything looks stylish and epic. This makes the game accessible yet deep for veterans.
The levels, though not always varied, are built around dynamic skirmishes where visual effects (explosions, slow-motion, magical transformations) take center stage. Bayonetta often outshines DMC precisely in this spectacle, making every fight feel like a high-budget action movie.

Characters and Atmosphere: Charisma and Humor
Bayonetta as a character is a masterpiece: beautiful, charismatic, and full of sarcasm. Her jokes and demeanor add lightness, turning serious battles into an entertaining show. The other characters also contribute to the atmosphere, but the main heroine is the real star that makes the game memorable.

Replayability: Secrets and Mastery
The game is incredibly replayable: on the first playthrough, you won‚Äôt unlock all the accessories, weapons, and secrets, which motivates you to come back. Just like in DMC, here you can polish your skills, perfect combos, and aim for ideal runs. This isn‚Äôt just repeated playthroughs ‚Äî it‚Äôs an opportunity to grow as a player and enjoy the process.

Conclusion: Recommendation for Action Fans
Overall, Bayonetta is a must-play for everyone who loves slashers, and even for fans of action-RPGs. Unlike many modern action-RPGs, where progression often feels useless and fights are boring and monotonous, here every element works toward dynamics and spectacle. No boredom ‚Äî just pure adrenaline. If you‚Äôre a DMC fan or simply looking for action with soul, give it a try: the game is easier to master but doesn‚Äôt lag behind in depth and style.`,

    review: `This was the second game I completed on the Nintendo Switch, and it became a real step forward compared to the first part. Here, the developers took everything that was good from the original Bayonetta and improved it in almost every aspect: bosses became even more spectacular, locations ‚Äî noticeably more interesting and diverse, and new types of weapons add freshness to their use. In the end, this is an evolution of the first game, a refined version that feels like a must-have for fans of the genre. I recommend it to everyone who loves great action and slashers, and especially to fans of Bayonetta 1 and the Devil May Cry (DMC) series.`,
