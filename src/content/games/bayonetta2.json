  "review": "This was the second game I completed on the Nintendo Switch, and it became a real step forward compared to the first part. Here, the developers took everything that was good from the original Bayonetta and improved it in almost every aspect: bosses became even more spectacular, locations â€” noticeably more interesting and diverse, and new types of weapons add freshness to their use. In the end, this is an evolution of the first game, a refined version that feels like a must-have for fans of the genre. I recommend it to everyone who loves great action and slashers, and especially to fans of Bayonetta 1 and the Devil May Cry (DMC) series.",
