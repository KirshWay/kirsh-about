  "review": "I first played the original Cyberpunk 2077 almost at launch, back when the game was a real battlefield of bugs and disappointments. Since then, the developers from CD Projekt Red have seriously worked on updates, and I decided to return to evaluate the changes. In the end, it’s a solid action-RPG in a futuristic setting, but without any revolutionary breakthrough. It doesn’t evoke a storm of emotions, remaining at the level of a “good, but ordinary” game. It’s especially disappointing, considering that cyberpunk is my favorite genre.\n\nGameplay and Technical Side: From Catastrophe to Improvements\nAt the start, the launch version was a real nightmare: terrible optimization, raw gameplay, and a bunch of underdeveloped systems. The progression system seemed weak and uninteresting, and elements like the logic of police chases were simply absent. The world of Night City felt empty, without depth in interactions.\nHowever, after all the patches and updates, the picture has changed for the better. Now the progression is more complex and interesting — it integrates better into the gameplay, allowing experimentation with builds and tactics. Combat has become more dynamic, and the city feels more alive. Nevertheless, the choice system remains quite compressed, as in most action-RPGs. Compared to classic role-playing masterpieces like Baldur’s Gate 3, where decisions branch endlessly, everything here is simpler and more predictable.\nDespite the improvements, what saves the game above all is the atmosphere: neon lights, stylish design, and a soundtrack that perfectly conveys the cyberpunk vibe. Without this, it risked sinking into mediocrity.\n\nPlot and Characters: Interesting, but Not Ideal\nI completed the game even in its initial, “raw” state, and it didn’t leave strong emotions — just a pleasant adventure without a wow-effect. The overall tone is dark and cynical, which fits the genre, but it doesn’t always touch the soul.\n\nDLC Phantom Liberty: Disappointment in Dogtown\nI also played the DLC Phantom Liberty, which many praise as the best thing that happened to the game. Alas, I liked it less. The new location — Dogtown — seemed boring and monotonous, without the spark that the main Night City has. The characters here are bland, lacking charisma, and the story with its resolution came out obvious and primitive. Everything is too straightforward, without depth or surprises.\nThe plus is that the new ending from the DLC harmoniously fits into the tone of the original — it maintains the same melancholy and hopelessness. If you’re a fan of the lore, this might hook you, but for me, the DLC didn’t live up to the hype.\n\nConclusion: Hopes for the Future\nOverall, Cyberpunk 2077 after the updates is a solid game worth trying for its atmosphere, style, and music. But CD Projekt Red advertised it too aggressively as a revolution in the industry, promising to change everything. In reality, we got an ordinary title where the potential isn’t fully realized — more systems, depth, and innovations could have been added.\nPersonally, I’m disappointed in the project: as a cyberpunk fan, I was waiting for a masterpiece but got “what we have is what we have.” Nevertheless, I’ll look forward to the sequel with interest and wish the team to implement all their planned ideas. The main thing is to approach marketing more cautiously to avoid repeating mistakes. If you haven’t played yet, start with the updated version — it’s worth your time, especially if you love neon and hacker adventures.",
