  "review": "In my childhood, I played a lot of classic RPGs — the Fallout series, Neverwinter Nights, Arcanum, Planescape: Torment, and other genre masterpieces. That’s why I was particularly interested in what Larian Studios, the creators of Divinity: Original Sin, would come up with for the continuation of the legendary series. I really liked the game, although I played it during a period when time was tight (and even now, there’s not much of it 😵‍💫😅). I recommend starting it when you’re not too busy with other things — this will allow you to fully immerse yourself. And if possible, play with someone close: a joint adventure with a loved one will make the experience even brighter and more emotional.\n\nImmersion in the World: A Full-Fledged Universe\nBaldur’s Gate 3 is not just a game, but a living, breathing world full of interesting characters and captivating adventures. Larian Studios have created a space where every decision affects the environment: you can explore hidden corners, interact with NPCs, and shape the story through choices. This is especially noticeable in the plot, which branches depending on your actions and decisions for your companions. For regular players, this means hours of engaging exploration, and for industry veterans — an example of masterful narrative where nonlinearity doesn’t feel artificial but organically weaves into the gameplay.\n\nGameplay: Choices and Build-Crafting\nThe process of creating builds here is a real pleasure for fans of classic RPGs. You can experiment with classes, abilities, and tactics, adding depth and replayability. The battles are tactical, requiring strategy, yet accessible. I’ve seen criticism from hardcore fans of the series and classic RPGs — saying Larian simplified some aspects. You can partially agree with that, but let’s admit: the classic RPG genre isn’t as popular nowadays, and the studio adapted it for a wider audience without losing the essence. In the end, they did everything right — the game balances depth and accessibility, making it appealing to both newcomers and gaming industry experts who value innovations in design.\n\nAtmosphere and Characters: Emotions and Engagement\nThe characters here are alive and multifaceted, with deep backstories and dialogues that react to your choices. The atmosphere of Forgotten Realms is conveyed perfectly: from gloomy dungeons to epic quests. This creates a sense of a real adventure where every step can change the outcome — ideal for those seeking emotional immersion.\n\nConclusion: Recommendation with a Caveat\nOverall, Baldur’s Gate 3 is an outstanding example of a modern RPG that respects the genre’s roots but makes it relevant. Definitely give it a try if you love deep stories and tactical gameplay. I myself plan to return when I have more time and the mood for full immersion in this world again.",
