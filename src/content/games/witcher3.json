  "review": "For me, The Witcher 3 is currently the best game from CD Projekt Red. My assessment is based on my last playthrough, which was about two years ago, and perhaps if I replayed it now, my impressions might shift. That said, considering I've sunk 461 hours into it and can't even remember how many full runs I've done, including the two DLCs—especially \"Blood and Wine,\" which I consider one of the best expansions in gaming history. Typically, DLCs aren't such massive chunks of content, but here, if another company had made something similar, it could easily be sold as a standalone game at full price. As someone deeply versed in games and who sometimes thinks like a game designer, I see this as a brilliant approach: the DLC doesn't just add on; it expands the world, offering a full-fledged story and mechanics on par with the main campaign.\n\nGameplay-wise, the game draws you in deeply, though looking back now, the mechanics don't seem as intricately developed or refined as they felt at the time. Still, even today, I think it'd be fun to replay it—and I probably will before the release of the fourth installment in the series. A great indicator of the game's quality for me is that I initially played through the first and second parts—they were solid—but it was only after The Witcher 3's release that I dove so deeply into the lore, world, and characters that I went on to read all the main Witcher books. So, even if I note that the gameplay mechanics aren't overly complex, the fact that the game inspired me to explore the source material speaks volumes.\n\nIn the end, I can say that I recommend everyone play The Witcher 3 at least once, and if you enjoy it, go for the first and second parts too—then you might even try reading the books.",
