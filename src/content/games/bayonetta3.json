  "review": "I've finished playing Bayonetta 3, the latest installment in this epic series. Just like the previous games, it completely captivated me, though initially, the demon summoning mechanic raised some mild concerns—it seemed like the fights as Bayonetta might take a backseat. Fortunately, that didn't happen; in reality, it's a fantastic addition that brings fresh variety and spawns a ton of new, truly epic situations in the gameplay. As someone who knows games well and sometimes thinks like a game designer, I see this as a smart move: the demons don't steal the show but enhance it, allowing you to combine attacks into even more spectacular combos.\n\nThe changes to the weapon equipping system are also worth noting. In the first two parts, you could separately equip weapons to hands and feet, creating hybrid sets. Now, the choice is between two full loadouts—one for hands and feet or another, with quick switching between them. Personally, I prefer the old approach from Bayonetta 1 and 2; it gave more room for experimentation. But the new variant isn't worse: it simplifies balance and fits better into modern slashers, where the emphasis is on dynamics and quick decisions. In the end, it's not a downside but an evolution that makes the game more accessible without sacrificing depth.\n\nOverall, Bayonetta 3 is pure madness in the best sense of the word. Every level bombards you with new mechanics, and many of them stun with their visual flair. Take, for example, controlling a train that turns into a wind-up toy, or transforming into the train itself—these moments shatter expectations and add chaos. In short, the levels are incredibly diverse in terms of gameplay mechanics: they don't delve deeply into every idea, which can make the game feel a bit drawn out at times. But that's not an issue—the mechanics are so fun and cool that they keep you engaged, making you smile at the absurdity and creativity. From a design perspective, it's a masterclass in preventing player boredom by introducing fresh elements without overwhelming the experience.\n\nThe new playable character, Viola, is another bright highlight. Her slasher mechanics are fresh, and she's fun in her own right, perfectly diluting the sections with Bayonetta and adding variety to the game's rhythm. As a result, Bayonetta 3 comes out much more dynamic than its predecessors: it generates a bunch of unique situations, doesn't let you get bored, and maintains the high style of the characters. The mechanics, as before, are cool and balanced—not as overloaded as in Devil May Cry, but they constantly encourage experimentation, pushing you to try new combinations and tactics.\n\nOut of the entire trilogy, I'd recommend Bayonetta 3 to newcomers and those craving maximum madness in action. It's one of the craziest games I've ever played—a true festival of creativity and adrenaline. I'll definitely return to unlock all the gear and secrets; there's plenty to do even after the credits.",
