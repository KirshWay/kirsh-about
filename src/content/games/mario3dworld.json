  "review": "This was my first game that I completed on the Nintendo Switch, and it left me with exclusively positive impressions. At first glance, the project might seem like purely children's entertainment, but its strong side is in its ability to challenge even the most experienced gamers. Thanks to thoughtful game design, the game offers flexibility: those who prefer an easy playthrough without extra complexities can simply enjoy the adventure, while enthusiasts get the opportunity to dive deep into collecting all available items. The plot here is truly secondary ‚Äî the developers clearly prioritized gameplay, where each level offers unique mechanics and situations, making them genuinely memorable and diverse.\n\nGameplay: Perfect Balance for Everyone\nThe main charm of Super Mario 3D World lies in its accessibility and depth at the same time. Levels are built to provide a basic path for casual players, while hiding numerous secrets and challenges for those seeking a real test. Collecting stars, coins, and other items turns into an engaging process that motivates exploring every corner. This isn't just a platformer ‚Äî it's a masterclass in design, where creative mechanics (from costumes with superpowers to cooperative mode) make the playthrough fresh and dynamic.\n\nDLC Bowser's Fury: A Fresh Take on the Classic\nI also completed the DLC Bowser's Fury, and it truly hooked me. The shift in camera perspective to a more open, almost open-world style adds new dynamics to the adventure, with the collecting process taking center stage. Exploring locations brings real pleasure ‚Äî that sense of freedom and joy from discoveries is something I rarely encounter even in modern AAA projects. Battles with the giant Bowser add epicness, and the integration of collecting with the main gameplay makes the DLC compact yet rich in experience. If the original focuses on linear levels, here the emphasis is on free exploration, which perfectly complements the base game.\n\nVisuals and Atmosphere: Brightness and Nostalgia\nThe visual style in both the main game and the DLC is simply captivating: bright colors, cute animations, and detailed worlds create an atmosphere of pure fun. I'm definitely coming back to collect all the collectible items in both parts ‚Äî this process doesn't get boring and only heightens the desire to replay levels.\n\nConclusion: Recommendation for Adventure Lovers\nOverall, Super Mario 3D World + Bowser's Fury is an excellent example of how developers can create timeless classics that delight both newcomers and hardcore fans. The game doesn't chase a complex plot but wins through flawless gameplay, variety, and visual charm. If you're a Switch owner and haven't tried it yet, this is a must-play ‚Äî especially for those who appreciate platformers with exploration elements. I'm thrilled and eagerly await the chance to return for the remaining trophies.",
